## Install
- Drag "MABNSSLider.swift" to your Xcode project. 

## Using Interface Builder
- Add an NSSlider to your view.
- Edit the class name to be "MABSlider" instead of "NSSlider".
- Edit your appdelegate as below:

```
@IBOutlet var slider2: MABSlider!

func applicationDidFinishLaunching(aNotification: NSNotification) {
    slider2.setKnobImage(NSImage(named: "knob")!)
    slider2.setBarFillImage(NSImage(named: "fill")!)
    slider2.setBarFillBeforeKnobImage(NSImage(named: "beforeknob")!)
    slider2.setBarLeftAgeImage(NSImage(named: "leftage")!)
    slider2.setBarRightAgeImage(NSImage(named: "rightage")!)
}
  
@IBAction func slider2Changed(_ sender: MABSlider) {
	// your code goes here
	NSLog("\(slider2.floatValue)")
}

```

### Caution!
When using a MABSlider inside a custom Cocoa class and a xib file the action is not sent. To fix go in the interface builder, select the NSSliderCell inside the MABSlider this edit the class name to be "MABSliderCell".

## Using Code

Edit your appdelegate as below:

```
var slider:MABSlider!


  func applicationDidFinishLaunching(aNotification: NSNotification) {
    // Insert code here to initialize your application
    
    slider = MABSlider(knob: NSImage(named: "knob")!, barFill: NSImage(named: "fill")!, barFillBeforeKnob: NSImage(named: "beforeknob")!, barLeftAge: NSImage(named: "leftage")!, barRightAge: NSImage(named: "rightage")!);
    slider.frame = NSMakeRect(20, 20, 200, 21);
    slider.action = "sliderChanged"
    
    window.contentView?.addSubview(slider);
    
  }
  
  func sliderChanged() {
    // your code goes here 
    NSLog("\(slider.floatValue)")
  }
  
```
